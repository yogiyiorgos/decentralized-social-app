# Decetralized social media app
This decentralized social media app, built with React, utilizes
              the Lens Protocol, a composable and decentralized social graph.
              This enables users to easily connect to the decentralized network,
              retrieve and follow other users, and make posts. With MetaMask
              integration, users can securely connect and interact with the
              userbase stored on the blockchain. This provides a new level of
              trust and privacy, ensuring secure and transparent data storage.
              With the use of GraphQL, the app ensures efficient and flexible
              data retrieval and manipulation.
